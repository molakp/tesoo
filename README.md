# TESOO: The Elder Scrolls Online Ontology

TESOO is an ontology built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent the knowledge and concepts related to The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) game. The ontology was developed as part of the Semantic Web course 2021/2022.

## Background
The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in the world of Tamriel. The game has a vast amount of lore and knowledge that is scattered across various sources, including books, quests, and in-game items. TESOO aims to consolidate this knowledge into a single ontology that can be used to power various applications, including chatbots, question-answering systems, and recommendation engines.

## Features
TESOO includes concepts such as races, classes, skills, items, quests, and locations. The ontology also models relationships between these concepts, such as "hasSkill", "isLocatedIn", and "isPartOf". TESOO is designed to be extendable, allowing for the addition of new concepts and relationships as needed.

## Usage
TESOO can be used by developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in building applications related to ESO. The ontology is available in OWL format and can be imported into various ontology editors and knowledge graph platforms, such as Protégé and Neo4j.
