TESOO: The Elder Scrolls Online Ontology

I'm building an ontology to represent some concepts in ESO for the  Semantic Web course 2021/2022.
This work couldn't be possible without the amazing community that's behind:
- Uesp.net https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page
-  https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Elder+Scrolls+Online+Wiki
- https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Online

and of course every right belongs to the respective owner!
