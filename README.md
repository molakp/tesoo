TESOO: The Elder Scrolls Online Ontology

I am building an ontology to represent some concepts in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) for the Semantic Web course 2021/2022. This work would not be possible without the amazing community behind it, including:

- Uesp.net (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page)
- Elder Scrolls Online Wiki (https://elderscrollsonline.wiki.fextralife.com/Elder+Scrolls+Online+Wiki)
- Elder Scrolls Fandom (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Online)
